a number like 2.0 and it will resize each selected item from its center by 2x

a number plus "w" or "h" it will scale proportionally to that width or height from the item's center

Add any of "bl", "le", "tl", "to", "tr", "ri", "br", "bo"  to resize from the item's bottomleft, left, topleft. top, topright, right, bottom right or bottom, instead

Other then the number having to be first, these can be in any order, with or without spaces
